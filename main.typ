= Introduction video

Each applicant should submit a short video (max 2 minutes) where they tell about themselves, their background, interests, and portfolio highlights in English. Please start with a brief (max 20s) shot where you introduce yourself, speaking to the camera. After that, please include and explain content such as gameplay clips of games that you have made or other relevant content that showcases your skills. Please note that in addition to your best game projects, we are interested in all forms of creativity, so you can also show other forms of art or creative work. For each project shown on the video, please clearly state or add subtitles that state the year and your role or contribution such as programming, art or design.

Note that you can film yourself using a smartphone camera—we do not expect the applicants to have professional video production equipment. For editing the video, there are free software tools such as DaVinci Resolve.

The video should be submitted as a link in a pdf file named “Introduction_Video.pdf”. The link can be to an unlisted or private YouTube video, for instance. If the video is password-protected, the password must be included in the PDF. Please make sure that the link is clickable or can be easily copied from the PDF.

The video will be only viewed by the evaluators. However, if you are selected, we will ask for your permission to share the video with other selected students.

= Curriculum Vitae (CV)

Applications must include the applicant’s CV (single PDF-file) indicating personal data, educational background, work experience, exhibitions, publications and articles, awards and grants, study trips and positions of trust.

= Portfolio

Please upload a PDF named “Portfolio-lastname-firstname.pdf” (max 1.0GB). The PDF can be one of the following:

A link to an online portfolio (this is the preferred option)

If you don’t have an online portfolio, you may submit a traditional PDF portfolio. Please include links to videos or playable games when possible.

For each project included, please clearly state the year and your role or contribution.

An online portfolio is highly preferred, as if you are selected, we will ask your permission to share your portfolio and contact information with other selected students to facilitate networking and community building.
