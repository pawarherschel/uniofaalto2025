    <p>Heya,</p>
    <p>My name is Herschel Pravin Pawar,</p>
    <p>I also go by Kat.</p>
    <p>This video was recorded as part of my</p>
    <p>Aalto application.</p>
    <p>Last year I set out to learn Bevy,</p>
    <p>an ECS-based game engine</p>
    <p>written in Rust.</p>
    <p>I wanted to encourage the player to take risks.</p>
    <p>So,</p>
    <p>the player’s damage,</p>
    <p>projectiles,</p>
    <p>and score</p>
    <p>increase with</p>
    <p>the number of projectiles</p>
    <p>parried at once.</p>
    <p>After learning the basics,</p>
    <p>I participated in Bevy Jam 6.</p>
    <p>I also made an online leaderboard for the game.</p>
    <p>I placed</p>
    <p>sixtyth</p>
    <p>out of</p>
    <p>ninety-eight.</p>
    <p>This year</p>
    <p>I got an itch</p>
    <p>to do pixel art again</p>
    <p>and participated as a pixel artist</p>
    <p>for the GameDev.tv Game Jam 2025.</p>
    <p>We incorporated</p>
    <p>the theme</p>
    <p>through aesthetics</p>
    <p>and story.</p>
    <p>The art team</p>
    <p>had one more person.</p>
    <p>My teammate</p>
    <p>was more</p>
    <p>experienced</p>
    <p>and faster</p>
    <p>than me.</p>
    <p>My biggest contribution was a</p>
    <p>three-by-three</p>
    <p>minimal</p>
    <p>autotile</p>
    <p>tileset.</p>
    <p>Cosmical One,</p>
    <p>my teammate,</p>
    <p>drew beautiful backgrounds,</p>
    <p>but they made it hard</p>
    <p>to see the platforms</p>
    <p>and enemies.</p>
    <p>I wanted players</p>
    <p>to appreciate the backgrounds</p>
    <p>without losing the gameplay.</p>
    <p>So,</p>
    <p>I finally got</p>
    <p>to make a shader.</p>
    <p>We placed</p>
    <p>twenty-fourth</p>
    <p>out of</p>
    <p>one thousand and ten.</p>
    <p>Until last year,</p>
    <p>I was unsure about game dev.</p>
    <p>I didn’t know any game devs IRL,</p>
    <p>so when one of my friends</p>
    <p>told me about a summer school program,</p>
    <p>I took the</p>
    <p>opportunity.</p>
    <p>I met a lot of people there,</p>
    <p>talked to a lot of people,</p>
    <p>especially from the games industry,</p>
    <p>and concluded that</p>
    <p>I do want to pursue game dev.</p>
    <p>The finale for the</p>
    <p>summer school was</p>
    <p>a game jam.</p>
    <p>We incorporated</p>
    <p>the theme</p>
    <p>into the lore,</p>
    <p>which was reflected in the game</p>
    <p>as a mechanic.</p>
    <p>My partner had been programming for less time than me,</p>
    <p>but he plays</p>
    <p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</p>
    <p>and acts as the dungeon master,</p>
    <p>so he was better at</p>
    <p>lore building,</p>
    <p>game mechanics,</p>
    <p>and other aspects.</p>
    <p>We placed</p>
    <p>second</p>
    <p>out of</p>
    <p>four.</p>
    <p>This was also the first game</p>
    <p>I made with Godot</p>
    <p>that was not just</p>
    <p>a proof of concept.</p>
    <p>And it made me realize</p>
    <p>that I enjoy game dev</p>
    <p>even if I’m bad at ideas.</p>
    <p>I enjoy the process of making games.</p>
    <p>I placed</p>
    <p>four thousand</p>
    <p>six hundred</p>
    <p>fifty second</p>
    <p>out of</p>
    <p>six thousand seven hundred third.</p>
    <p>I tend to</p>
    <p>write program</p>
    <p>for problems I have.</p>
    <p>So when I wanted</p>
    <p>to extract a color palette</p>
    <p>from an image.</p>
    <p>The existing tools were annoying,</p>
    <p>I made the tool myself.</p>
    <p>I first checked Rosetta Code,</p>
    <p>but they didn’t have the median-cut algorithm,</p>
    <p>so I contributed</p>
    <p>the rust code.</p>
    <p>I know I stand</p>
    <p>on the shoulders of</p>
    <p>giants.</p>
    <p>This video would</p>
    <p>not have</p>
    <p>been</p>
    <p>possible</p>
    <p>without generations of</p>
    <p>people who came</p>
    <p>before me.</p>
    <p>There are so many people</p>
    <p>who influenced me,</p>
    <p>but I don’t remember.</p>
    <p>I hope</p>
    <p>one day someone will look</p>
    <p>at my work and be influenced.</p>
